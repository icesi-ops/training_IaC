inventory=./ansible_hosts
remote_user=vagrant
private_key_file=$HOME/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
```
2. Make ansible_hosts
```
[servers]
192.168.33.11
192.168.33.12
```

3. Run Vagrantfile
```
vagrant up
```
4. We does test that everything machine is reachable
```
ansible -m ping all
```
5. Now lets play

```
ansible all -a "whoami"
ansible all -a "uname -a"
ansible all -a "pwd"
```
6. Groups: add to ansible_host the db server
```
db ansible_ssh_host=192.168.33.100
```

```
ansible dbservers -a "whoami"
```

[first:children]
servers
dbservers

```
ansible --list-host all
